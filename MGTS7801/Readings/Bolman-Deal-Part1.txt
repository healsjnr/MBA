Boleman and Deal, Part 1

Chapter 1:
  - Interoduces the concept of :reframing. The idea that the organisation can be viewed through a series of frames that allow managers to better understand the
    forces driving the business.
  - Four Frames:
    :structural - factories
    :human_resources - families
    :political - jungles
    :symbolic - temples
  - Cluelessness is a recurring principle. Without awareness, managers continue doing what they know, oblivious to the fact that there are serious errors with it.
